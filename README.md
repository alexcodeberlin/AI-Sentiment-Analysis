# AI-Sentiment-Analysis<br>


# Setup the project and try if your sentence is sarcastic or not<br><br>
1. Clone the repository and run it with visual studio code.<br>
2. Run the script<br>
3. When the Plots are poping up you have to close them. Then the code will go on and show outputs in the console<br>
4. Scroll down to the last lines in the code. There is the sentence variable. Type in a sentence to find out if the trained model think it is sarcastic or not. The Output values ins the console are between 0.1, 0.2... to 1. The number one is sarcastic and the nnumber zero is not sarcastic.

# Project Description<br>
This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build a neural network for detecting sarcasm in headlines. The dataset, containing headlines and corresponding sarcasm labels, is loaded and preprocessed using tokenization and padding techniques. A neural network model is constructed with an embedding layer followed by global average pooling and dense layers. The model is trained on the dataset to achieve accurate sarcasm detection and its performance is visualized through accuracy and loss graphs. Additionally, word embeddings are extracted and visualized for further analysis.
